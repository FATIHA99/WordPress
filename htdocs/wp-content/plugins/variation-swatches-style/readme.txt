Smart WooCommerce Swatches, Photos And Filter by Attribute  – Convert your normal variable attribute dropdown select to nicely looking color, image, label, text, or dropdown. You can display product colors, sizes, styles, and anything else in the better way which is not supported by default WooCommerce. Display them in round or square mode.

Moreover, the plugins can also be used for direct product filtering by Attributes as widgets. This allows customers to discover goods that align with their specific colour and design preferences quickly.
